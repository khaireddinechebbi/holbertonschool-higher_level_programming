# Python - Import & Modules

## Description
This project covers the concepts of importing and using modules in Python. The exercises explore different ways of importing modules, handling command-line arguments, and creating reusable code structures.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the purpose of modules in Python.
- Differentiate between various import techniques.
- Use `sys.argv` to handle command-line arguments.
- Create and import custom modules.
- Use built-in Python functions to optimize code structure.
