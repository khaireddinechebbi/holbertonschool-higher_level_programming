# Python - Serialization

## Description
This project explores the concepts of marshaling and serialization, essential techniques for data storage and transmission. You will learn how to transform memory objects into formats suitable for persistence and communication across different systems. The project also introduces JSON and Pickle serialization methods in Python, allowing you to serialize and deserialize data effectively for various applications, such as web development, databases, and network communication.
