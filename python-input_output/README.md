# Python - Abstract Classes and Interfaces

## Description
This project covers the basics of working with file input and output in Python. You will learn how to open, read, write, and manipulate files. Additionally, the project introduces you to the concept of JSON serialization and deserialization, which is essential for working with APIs and storing data in a standardized format. By the end of this project, you will have a strong understanding of how Python handles file operations and data serialization.

## Files

| Filename | Description |
|----------|------------|
| `0-read_file.py` | Function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout. |
| `1-write_file.py` | Function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written. |
| `2-append_write.py` | Function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added. |
| `3-to_json_string.py` | Function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string). |
| `4-from_json_string.py` | Function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string. |
| `5-save_to_json_file.py` | Function that writes an Object to a text file, using JSON representation. |
| `6-load_from_json_file.py` | Function that creates an Object from a JSON file. |
| `7-add_item.py` | Function that adds all arguments to a Python list and saves them to a file. |
| `8-class_to_json.py` | Function that returns the dictionary description for a JSON serialization of an object. |
| `9-student.py` | Class Student that defines a student by its first name, last name, and age, and includes a method to return a JSON serializable dictionary. |
| `10-student.py` | Class Student with a method to_json(attrs=None) that retrieves a dictionary representation of an instance, filtering attributes if attrs is a list of strings. |
| `11-student.py` | Class Student with methods to_json(attrs=None) for serialization and reload_from_json(json) for deserialization from a dictionary. |
| `12-pascal_triangle.py` | Function pascal_triangle(n) that returns a list of lists of integers representing Pascalâ€™s triangle of n. Returns an empty list if n <= 0. |
