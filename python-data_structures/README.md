# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Description
This project covers the concepts of data structures in Python, specifically lists and tuples. The exercises explore the fundamentals of working with lists, understanding their similarities and differences with strings, and using them as stacks and queues. It also dives into tuple operations, including packing, unpacking, and comparison with lists.
