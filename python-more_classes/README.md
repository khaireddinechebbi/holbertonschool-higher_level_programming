# Python - More Classes and Objects

## Description
In this series of tasks, you will explore the creation and enhancement of a Rectangle class. Each task builds upon the previous one by adding new features and refining the class. The exercises cover concepts such as private attributes, getter and setter methods, string representations, static and class methods, object destructors, and instance tracking.

## Files

Hereâ€™s a table summarizing the filenames and descriptions for the tasks you've shared:

| Filename | Description |
|----------|------------|
| `0-rectangle.py` | Defines an empty `Rectangle` class without any attributes or methods. |
| `1-rectangle.py` | Defines a `Rectangle` class with private instance attributes `width` and `height` with corresponding getter and setter methods. |
| `2-rectangle.py` | Adds methods to calculate the `area` and `perimeter` of a rectangle, and handles invalid input for `width` and `height`. |
| `3-rectangle.py` | Enhances `Rectangle` class with a string representation (`__str__` and `__repr__` methods) to print a rectangle using `#` characters. |
| `4-rectangle.py` | Introduces the `eval` function to allow creation of a new `Rectangle` object from its string representation. |
| `5-rectangle.py` | Adds a destructor to print "Bye rectangle..." when a `Rectangle` object is deleted. |
| `6-rectangle.py` | Introduces a class variable `number_of_instances` to track how many instances of the `Rectangle` class are created. |
| `7-rectangle.py` | Adds properties for `width` and `height` with validation, class attributes for instance count, and custom print behavior with `print_symbol`. |
| `8-rectangle.py` | Adds a static method `bigger_or_equal` to compare two rectangles based on area, and returns the biggest one. |
| `9-rectangle.py` | Introduces a class method `square` to return a new `Rectangle` instance where width and height are equal. |
