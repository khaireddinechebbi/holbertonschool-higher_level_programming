# Python - Classes and Objects

## Description
This project covers Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, specifically focusing on classes and objects. The key idea is to create Python classes that represent real-world entities, define attributes for these classes, and use methods to perform actions. You'll learn how to encapsulate data, hide implementation details, and work with object instances.

## Files

| Filename | Description |
|----------|------------|
| `0-square.py` | Defines an empty class Square that creates an object of type Square. |
| `1-square.py` | Defines a Square class with a private instance attribute size and instantiates the square object with a size argument. |
| `2-square.py` | Extends the Square class with validation for the size attribute: it must be an integer and greater than or equal to 0. Raises TypeError and ValueError exceptions. |
| `3-square.py` | Adds an area() method to the Square class that calculates and returns the area of the square. |
| `4-square.py` | Introduces getters and setters for the size attribute in the Square class, with validation for type and value. The area() method is still present. |
| `5-square.py` | Enhances the Square class by adding a my_print() method that prints the square using the # character. Handles case when size is 0 by printing an empty line. |
| `6-square.py` | Defines a square with a size and position attribute. Adds validation for both attributes and a my_print() method that prints the square at a specified position, using spaces for indentation. |
