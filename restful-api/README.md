# Python - Abstract Classes and Interfaces

## Description
This project aims to demonstrate the process of consuming, processing, and serving data through REST APIs using Python. The primary tasks involve interacting with public APIs, creating simple APIs with Flask, and securing APIs through basic authentication and JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
